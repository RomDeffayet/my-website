I joined the IRLab of the University in Amsterdam in January 2022 as a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Maarten de Rijke, in partnership with Naver Labs Europe where Jean-Michel Renders is advising me.

Previously, I had been working as a research engineer at Naver Labs Europe in Grenoble, France and at Huawei in Stockholm, Sweden.

My researches resolves mostly around reinforcement learning for recommender systems, including distributional RL and click modeling for unbiased offline RL.
